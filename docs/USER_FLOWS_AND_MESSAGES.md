# Taja User Flows and Bot Messages

This document captures the live WhatsApp and web user journeys for Taja.

It is written for product, design, engineering, QA, support, and operations teams.

## How to Read This Doc

- `User message` means the exact kind of message a user can send to Taja.
- `Bot response` means the canonical message Taja sends back in the current implementation.
- Some bot responses are dynamic and change based on user data, products, orders, or configuration.
- Where a flow uses buttons, lists, or WhatsApp Flows, the user still receives the same underlying intent, but the UI may be interactive instead of plain text.

## 1. New User Flow

This is the first journey for someone who has not fully joined yet.
